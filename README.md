### How the Game Works
- This is a two-player trivia game where you select your game settings, and the API will generate random trivia questions. Each player alternates turns answering questions. For each correct answer, a player earns a point. The player with the most points at the end wins the game.

### What Has Been Done
- Currently, some UI components, such as the main menu and quiz gameplay screen, are completed. The game also works in the console. Additionally, weâ€™ve implemented data persistence, saving each game's score to a text file called `result.txt`.
